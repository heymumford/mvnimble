# ADR 001: Shell Script Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

MVNimble is a shell-based utility designed to analyze and optimize Maven test execution across different environments. As the codebase grows, we need a clear architectural approach to ensure maintainability, readability, and stability.

Traditional shell scripts often suffer from several problems:

1. **Monolithic Design**: Single, large scripts that are difficult to maintain
2. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: Functions that mix responsibilities
3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Ad-hoc handling of error conditions
4. **Dependency Issues**: No clear management of dependencies
5. **Platform Inconsistencies**: Different behaviors on different operating systems

We need to design a shell script architecture that addresses these issues and provides a solid foundation for MVNimble.

## Decision

We will implement a modular shell script architecture with the following key principles:

1. **Module-Based Organization**: Split functionality into separate modules based on responsibility:
   - `constants.sh`: Central repository for all constants
   - `dependency_check.sh`: Validation of required dependencies
   - `environment_detection.sh`: Environment analysis and detection
   - `platform_compatibility.sh`: Cross-platform abstraction layer
   - `test_analysis.sh`: Maven test execution and analysis
   - `reporting.sh`: Result analysis and reporting

2. **Clear Module Interfaces**: Each module will:
   - Declare its dependencies at the top
   - Provide well-named functions with clear documentation
   - Use local variables to prevent namespace pollution
   - Handle errors consistently

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Use a central dependency check module to validate all requirements
   - Fail fast with clear error messages when dependencies are not met
   - Document all external dependencies

4. **Platform Abstraction**:
   - Provide platform-specific implementations behind common interfaces
   - Isolate platform-specific code in a dedicated module
   - Test across targeted platforms

5. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Use consistent error codes and messaging
   - Provide informative error messages with potential solutions
   - Clean up resources appropriately on exit

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved Maintainability**: Modular code is easier to maintain and extend
- **Enhanced Testability**: Isolated modules can be tested individually
- **Better Collaboration**: Clear module boundaries make collaboration easier
- **Reduced Duplication**: Common functionality is centralized
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized approach to handling errors
- **Platform Independence**: Clear abstractions for platform-specific code

### Negative

- **Additional Complexity**: More files to manage compared to a monolithic script
- **Loading Overhead**: Slight performance impact from loading multiple modules
- **Development Discipline**: Requires discipline to maintain module boundaries

### Neutral

- **Learning Curve**: New contributors must understand the modular approach
- **Configuration Management**: Need to ensure modules can find each other in various installation scenarios

## Implementation Notes

1. **Module Loading Mechanism**:
```bash
# Determine script directory in a portable way
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Load modules
source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/modules/constants.sh"
source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/modules/dependency_check.sh"
# ...
```

2. **Function Declaration Pattern**:
```bash
function function_name() {
    # Validate parameters
    local param1="$1"
    
    if [[ -z "$param1" ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Missing required parameter" >&2
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Function implementation
    local result
    # ...
    
    echo "$result"
    return 0
}
```

3. **Error Handling Pattern**:
```bash
function some_operation() {
    # ...
    if ! some_command; then
        echo "ERROR: Failed to perform operation" >&2
        return 1
    fi
    # ...
    return 0
}

# Usage with error handling
if ! some_operation "param"; then
    echo "Operation failed, exiting" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

4. **Module Interface Documentation**:
Each module should have a header comment describing:
- Purpose of the module
- Public functions provided
- Dependencies on other modules
- Usage examples
