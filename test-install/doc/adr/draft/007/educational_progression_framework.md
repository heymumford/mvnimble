# Educational Progression Framework for MVNimble

## Overview

This document defines a structured learning progression for QA engineers using MVNimble, providing a clear pathway from basic diagnostics to advanced statistical analysis of test performance. The framework is designed to gradually build expertise, with each level introducing more sophisticated concepts while reinforcing previous knowledge.

## Learning Progression Levels

### Level 1: Essential Diagnostic Foundations

- Interpreting MVNimble's basic reports

**Example exercises**:
```bash
# Example exercise 1: Basic timing analysis

- Capability to document and share diagnostic knowledge
- Skills in mentoring and knowledge democratization
- Expertise in system-wide test optimization strategies

## Integration with Simulation Scenarios

The educational progression framework integrates with the simulation scenarios defined in ADR 007 by providing appropriate scenarios for each learning level:

1. **Level 1**: Essential scenarios focusing on single-dimension issues (CPU usage, memory consumption, basic timing problems)

2. **Level 2**: Temporal scenarios and simple multi-factor scenarios with clear correlations

3. **Level 3**: Complex multi-factor scenarios requiring statistical analysis to identify root causes

4. **Level 4**: Advanced scenarios that combine multiple issues and require sophisticated diagnostic techniques

Each level includes example simulation commands to reinforce the learning objectives:

```bash
# Level 1 simulation example
mvnimble simulate basic_resource_exhaustion --resource cpu --intensity medium

# Level 2 simulation example
mvnimble simulate escalating_memory_leak --duration 5m --observation-points 10

# Level 3 simulation example
mvnimble simulate complex_io_contention --factors filesystem,network,cpu --interaction-level high

# Level 4 simulation example
mvnimble simulate custom_scenario custom_scenarios/microservice_degradation.json
```

## Didactic Principles

The educational framework is built on the following didactic principles:

1. **Progressive Complexity**: Each level builds on previous knowledge, gradually introducing more sophisticated concepts

2. **Practical Application**: Learning is tied directly to practical diagnostic tasks that QA engineers encounter

3. **Conceptual Understanding**: Focus on understanding "why" certain approaches work, not just "how" to use them

4. **Active Learning**: Interactive exercises require QA engineers to apply concepts in realistic scenarios

5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Framework encourages documentation and sharing of diagnostic insights

## Benefits for QA Teams

The educational progression framework provides several benefits for QA teams:

1. **Structured Learning Path**: Clear progression from basic to advanced diagnostic skills

2. **Consistent Knowledge Base**: Standardized approach to diagnostic knowledge across the team

3. **Self-Paced Development**: QA engineers can progress based on their current skill level and needs

4. **Knowledge Democratization**: Advanced diagnostic capabilities aren't limited to a few specialists

5. **Reduced Time-to-Competency**: Accelerated learning through focused, practical training

## Conclusion

This educational progression framework transforms MVNimble from a diagnostic tool into a comprehensive learning system for QA engineers. By providing a structured path from basic to advanced diagnostic capabilities, it addresses the identified gap in didactic utility and ensures that QA engineers can progressively build expertise in test diagnostics and optimization.
