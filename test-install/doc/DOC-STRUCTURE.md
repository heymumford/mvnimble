# MVNimble Documentation Structure

This file outlines the planned documentation structure after rationalization.

## Current Documentation Structure

- 17 documentation files (excluding ADRs)
- Many overlapping topics (testing, QA, installation, usage)
- Total lines: ~5000

## New Documentation Structure

1. **README.md** - Project overview, key features, quick start
2. **INSTALLATION.md** - Installation and setup guide  
3. **USAGE.md** - Consolidated user guide covering all usage scenarios
4. **TESTING.md** - Unified testing guide (consolidates 4 files)
5. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contributor guide, including conventions
6. **DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md** - Internal architecture and development information
7. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Problem resolution and diagnostic procedures

## Files to Consolidate

- QA-GUIDELINES.md → TESTING.md
- QA-ENGINEERS-GUIDE.md → TESTING.md
- TESTING-BEST-PRACTICES.md → TESTING.md
- FLAKY-TEST-DIAGNOSIS.md → TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- FLAKY-TEST-HUMOR.md → Remove (low value for documentation)
- REAL-TIME-MONITORING.md → USAGE.md
- OPTIMIZATION-INSIGHTS.md → USAGE.md
- DIAGNOSTIC-APPROACHES.md → TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- BUILD-FAILURE-MONITORING.md → USAGE.md
- CONVENTIONS.md → CONTRIBUTING.md
- CI-INTEGRATION.md → DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md
- REAL-WORLD-SCENARIOS.md → USAGE.md

## Expected Outcome

- Reduced from 17 files to 7 files
- More cohesive documentation structure
- Reduced total lines by ~50%
- Easier to navigate and maintain

## Timeline

1. Create new file structure
2. Consolidate content from original files
3. Edit for conciseness and clarity
4. Update cross-references
5. Validate and finalize
