# ADR 007: Build Failure Analysis and Metrics Collection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

QA engineers frequently encounter build failures in continuous integration environments. Traditionally, build failures are seen as binary outcomes (success/failure) with limited analysis beyond error logs. However, build failures represent valuable data points that could inform infrastructure optimization, dependency management, and resource allocation decisions.

Our current monitoring capabilities focus on successful test execution but miss opportunities to analyze patterns in build failures. QA engineers need insights into system behavior during build failures to make informed recommendations to development teams about build infrastructure.

## Decision

We will enhance MVNimble's "Test Engineering Tricorder" to continue collecting metrics during build failures and generate comprehensive build failure analysis reports. This includes:

1. Continuous monitoring of system resources (CPU, memory, I/O) during the build process
2. Correlation of resource usage patterns with specific build stages
3. Analysis of common failure patterns and their system resource implications
4. Generation of detailed reports with actionable recommendations for build infrastructure optimization

## Rationale

- **Real-world utility**: Builds frequently fail in real development environments; these failures represent valuable data points
- **Comprehensive monitoring**: Our tool should provide value regardless of build outcome
- **Infrastructure optimization**: Resource patterns during build failures can inform infrastructure scaling decisions
- **Dependency insights**: Build failures often reveal dependency issues that aren't obvious from error logs alone
- **CI/CD optimization**: QA engineers can use this data to recommend pipeline optimizations

## Implications

### Positive

- Provides value even during build failures
- Enables more holistic analysis of build system behavior
- Helps QA engineers make data-driven recommendations for build infrastructure
- Bridges the gap between test execution metrics and build metrics
- Increases the utility of our "Test Engineering Tricorder" in real-world environments

### Negative

- Requires careful error handling to ensure metric collection continues during build failure
- May generate large datasets for failed builds that need processing
- Requires distinguishing between different types of build failures

## Implementation

1. Modify the real-time monitoring feature to continue collecting metrics regardless of build outcome
2. Create a specialized Build Failure Analysis report template
3. Implement pattern recognition for common build failure types
4. Add recommendations for build infrastructure optimization based on resource usage patterns
5. Provide integration with CI systems to collect failure data across builds

## Examples

Examples of actionable insights from build failure analysis:

- Memory usage patterns during dependency resolution suggesting increased CI container memory
- CPU spikes during specific compilation phases suggesting parallelization adjustments
- I/O bottlenecks during artifact downloads suggesting caching strategies
- Correlation between build failure types and specific resource constraints

## Conclusion

By extending our monitoring capabilities to include build failure analysis, we make MVNimble's "Test Engineering Tricorder" valuable throughout the entire build lifecycle, not just during successful test execution. This comprehensive approach aligns with our goal of providing QA engineers with data-driven insights to improve the entire development process.
