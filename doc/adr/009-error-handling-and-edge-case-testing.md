# ADR 009: Error Handling and Edge Case Testing for Bash Components

## Status

Implemented

## Context

MVNimble's capabilities have expanded to include flaky test detection and thread visualization. These features introduce complexity in bash scripting and involve advanced processing, including parsing thread dumps, creating visualizations, and analyzing patterns across multiple test runs.

Our current testing approach does not sufficiently validate error handling, edge cases, or integration between components. Specifically:

1. **Error Handling Gaps**: Both thread_visualizer.sh and flaky_test_detector.sh modules have limited validation for error conditions like invalid inputs, file system limitations, and malformed data.

2. **Edge Case Coverage**: Unusual inputs, large files, complex deadlock patterns, and non-standard formats are not adequately tested.

3. **Integration Testing**: The interaction between modules, especially flaky test detection's integration with thread visualization, lacks comprehensive validation.

4. **Command-Line Interface Testing**: The CLI tools (mvnimble-thread-viz and mvnimble-detect-flaky) aren't systematically tested for argument validation and behavior.

These gaps could lead to unreliable behavior, difficult-to-diagnose failures, and potential security issues in production environments.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive test validation framework following Test-Driven Development principles that specifically addresses robustness, error handling, and edge cases. This includes:

1. **Error Handling Test Suite**: Systematically test how our components handle invalid inputs, missing files, permission issues, and malformed data.

2. **Edge Case Test Suite**: Verify behavior with unusual inputs, resource constraints, and complex scenarios (like multi-thread deadlocks).

3. **Integration Test Suite**: Validate the interaction between flaky test detection and thread visualization.

4. **CLI Validation Tests**: Ensure command-line tools properly validate inputs and handle errors gracefully.

The framework will be implemented using BATS (Bash Automated Testing System) and will follow a structured approach with fixtures, clear assertions, and comprehensive coverage.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Increased Reliability**: The system will be more resilient against unexpected inputs and conditions.

2. **Better Error Reporting**: Users will receive more actionable error messages when issues occur.

3. **Reduced Debugging Time**: With better test coverage, defects will be caught earlier and will be easier to diagnose.

4. **Documentation through Tests**: The test suite will serve as documentation for expected behavior in edge cases.

5. **Security Improvements**: Systematic validation will reduce the risk of security issues from improper input handling.

### Negative

1. **Development Overhead**: More time will be required to develop and maintain tests.

2. **Test Run Time**: The comprehensive test suite may take longer to execute.

3. **Complexity**: The test framework itself adds complexity to the codebase.

## Implementation Status

We have completed the first phase of implementation:

1. âœ… Created dedicated test files for thread visualizer:
   - `test_thread_visualizer_error_handling.bats` - Tests handling of invalid inputs, missing files, and edge cases
   - `test_thread_visualizer_edge_cases.bats` - Tests handling of complex deadlocks and unusual thread states
   
2. âœ… Created fixtures for testing:
   - Thread dumps with varying complexity
   - Invalid and malformed inputs
   - Complex deadlock patterns (2-thread and multi-thread cycles)
   - Unusually large thread dumps

3. âœ… Refactored thread visualizer to improve error handling:
   - Enhanced parameter validation
   - Added checks for empty files and invalid JSON
   - Improved error message clarity
   - Added fallbacks for missing dependencies
   - Implemented proper cleanup of temporary files
   - Enhanced deadlock detection algorithm for complex patterns

4. âœ… Created flaky test detector error handling tests:
   - `test_flaky_test_detector_error_handling.bats` - Tests handling of invalid inputs, missing files, and permission issues
   - Created fixtures for testing various error scenarios
   - Added tests for JSON validation, temporary file handling, and visualization integration

5. âœ… Enhanced flaky test detector module with robust error handling:
   - Added comprehensive parameter validation for all functions
   - Implemented checks for file existence, emptiness, and permissions
   - Added JSON validation with fallbacks when dependencies aren't available
   - Enhanced process flow with validation between steps
   - Improved error messages and warnings
   - Added proper temporary file cleanup with error handling
   - Implemented graceful degradation when visualization components fail

6. ðŸ”„ In progress:
   - `test_flaky_test_detector_edge_cases.bats`
   - `test_flaky_test_detector_thread_visualization_integration.bats`
   - `test_mvnimble_command_line_tools.bats`

7. ðŸ”„ Next steps:
   - Create integration tests between modules
   - Document error handling patterns and best practices
   - Add pre-commit hook to run error handling tests
   - Develop sample Maven project that exhibits flaky test behavior for validation
