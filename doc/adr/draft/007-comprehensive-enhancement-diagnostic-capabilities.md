# ADR 007: Comprehensive Enhancement of MVNimble's Diagnostic Capabilities

## Status

Proposed

## Context

MVNimble has been successful as a diagnostic tool for Maven test optimization, but several gaps have been identified in its capabilities:

1. **Problem Space Complexity**: The current architecture lacks a formal mathematical model of the test problem space, relying instead on heuristic approaches to diagnostics.

2. **Simulation Scenarios**: While MVNimble includes basic problem simulators, they lack systematic coverage of field-realistic test issues, particularly for complex multi-factor scenarios.

3. **Quantitative Analysis**: MVNimble's measurement capabilities currently focus on simple metrics without statistical rigor, limiting confidence in diagnostic conclusions.

4. **Didactic Utility**: There is no structured learning progression for QA engineers to develop expertise in test diagnostics and optimization.

5. **Field Usage Combinations**: MVNimble does not adequately handle combinations of issues that occur in real-world testing environments.

These gaps limit MVNimble's effectiveness as both a diagnostic tool and a learning platform for QA engineers. Without addressing these limitations, MVNimble's utility for complex test environments remains constrained, and QA engineers cannot fully develop their diagnostic capabilities.

## Decision

We will enhance MVNimble's diagnostic capabilities through a comprehensive approach that addresses each identified gap:

1. **Formal Problem Space Model**: Develop a mathematical representation of the test problem space with clearly defined dimensions, interactions, and measurement properties.

2. **Representative Simulation Scenarios**: Create a structured set of simulation scenarios that cover the full spectrum of test issues, from simple single-factor problems to complex multi-dimensional interactions.

3. **Statistical Analysis Framework**: Implement a rigorous statistical framework with confidence metrics to provide QA engineers with data-driven diagnostic conclusions.

4. **Educational Progression Framework**: Establish a structured learning progression that guides QA engineers from basic diagnostic concepts to advanced statistical analysis.

These enhancements will be implemented as extensions to MVNimble's existing architecture, maintaining backward compatibility while significantly expanding its capabilities.

## Formal Problem Space Model

  local measurements=("$@")
  local n=${#measurements[@]}
  local sum=0
  local sum_squared=0
  
  # Calculate mean and variance
  for value in "${measurements[@]}"; do
    sum=$(echo "$sum + $value" | bc -l)
    sum_squared=$(echo "$sum_squared + ($value * $value)" | bc -l)
  done
  
  local mean=$(echo "$sum / $n" | bc -l)
  local variance=$(echo "($sum_squared - ($sum * $sum) / $n) / ($n - 1)" | bc -l)
  local std_dev=$(echo "sqrt($variance)" | bc -l)
  
  # 95% confidence interval (using t-distribution approximation)
  # For simplicity, using 1.96 for z-score (large sample approximation)
  local margin_error=$(echo "1.96 * $std_dev / sqrt($n)" | bc -l)

  # Return t-statistic and degrees of freedom (p-value would need lookup tables)
  echo "$t_stat $df"

```bash
# Sample implementation of Bayesian confidence scoring for diagnostic conclusions

  local likelihood_ratio=1
  if [[ $(echo "$evidence_strength > 0" | bc -l) -eq 1 ]]; then
    # Positive evidence
    likelihood_ratio=$(echo "1 + (4 * $evidence_strength * $evidence_quality)" | bc -l)
  elif [[ $(echo "$evidence_strength < 0" | bc -l) -eq 1 ]]; then

  fi
  
  # Apply Bayes' theorem
  local posterior_probability=$(echo "($prior_probability * $likelihood_ratio) / \
    (($prior_probability * $likelihood_ratio) + ((1 - $prior_probability) * 1))" | bc -l)
  
  # Adjust by consistency factor
  local confidence_score=$(echo "$posterior_probability * (0.5 + 0.5 * $consistency_factor)" | bc -l)
  
  # Categorize confidence level
  local confidence_level="inconclusive"
  if [[ $(echo "$confidence_score >= 0.9" | bc -l) -eq 1 ]]; then
    confidence_level="very_high"
  elif [[ $(echo "$confidence_score >= 0.75" | bc -l) -eq 1 ]]; then
    confidence_level="high"
  elif [[ $(echo "$confidence_score >= 0.6" | bc -l) -eq 1 ]]; then

1. **Phased Implementation**: The phased implementation approach will manage complexity and allow for incremental validation.

2. **Educational Framework**: The educational progression framework is specifically designed to address the learning curve.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Careful implementation and optional advanced features will manage computational overhead.

4. **Documentation and Examples**: Comprehensive documentation and examples will facilitate maintenance.

## Conclusion

This ADR outlines a comprehensive approach to enhancing MVNimble's diagnostic capabilities through a formal problem space model, representative simulation scenarios, statistical analysis framework, and educational progression framework. These enhancements will significantly improve MVNimble's effectiveness as both a diagnostic tool and a learning platform for QA engineers.
